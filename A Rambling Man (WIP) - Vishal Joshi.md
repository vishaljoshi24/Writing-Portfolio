In the dry desert air, the guitar sounded tinny. This annoyed Old Tom Frost to no end, and made him play more sheepishly than he was used to. Frost's moniker was somewhat misleading seeing as he was not particularly old, just a man of full maturity which was a rarity in those days after the clocks were first turned off. He quickly realised standing on the pallet which made him just a smidge taller than most of his audience, that the gormless faces staring back at him as he howls and gnashes through the ballad, do not care. It was a noontime show. A pale and rude sun glared on this congregation of the damned, the roaches which refused to disappear when the world ended. With the realisation that his audience was composed of meat puppets, his confidence returned. In the grim, slightly mischievous set of his mouth you would notice that he had something up his dusty black sleeves. Old Tom pulled out his switchblade, which caused some of the front row to flinch, whilst he manipulated the guitar into an open tuning. The man always ended his sets with a dirge, the history of his art was constructed of such pieces. This one he called "Going Nowhere". It's the usual one, four and five of the Mississippi delta which cycles round and round whilst he slides up and down his mahogany resonator's neck using the ass end of his knife. Eventually it unfolds into a discordant solo of thrashing and twanging, petering out into a sorry little squeal. Depending on the crowd this draws either congratulatory applause or shouts of affronted anger. Most music is now gone but there remains something of the avant-garde in the zeitgeist of the continental south-west. This particular performance was answered with the leathery claps from the desert nomads he was performing for. 

"Thank you, thank you! My pleasure to perform for the Eastern Mojave Chapter of the Sons and Daughters of the Chupa Cabra", the final word trailing off into a fit of coughing that Tom often succumbed to, incubating in his lungs a bastard of a carcinoma. He stumbled off the stage. Moving towards a flung together bar under a corrugated iron awning at the northern edge of the camp, he ordered a whisky. Sipping it, feeling the slow warmth roll down his gullet he studied the congregation. He had come upon them at daybreak, a crude assortment of camps centred around a large yurt and the earliest risers smoking the wares of dead conglomerates, scrubbing themselves with sand washed off with water in that lithographic dawn. He had been spotted about half a mile out on a bicycle, his guitar and duffel poking out cartoonishly behind him. Frost had intentioned to cycle on, making for the Dead Mountains, a day's ride away. 

However, as he approached the encampment his way was slowly barred by tattooed and pierced youths, made dark by the Mojave sun but with features of a paler sort; pinched faces and lank hair trussed and shorn in a carnival manner. Two girls and a boy. The taller girl approached, baring her teeth in what he hoped was a smile, displaying filed-to-point incisors in a mouth sorely lacking teeth. "Morning there stranger. Kindly introduce yourself."
"My name's Tom. Tom Frost."

"Glad to make your acquaintance, I'm Mary Bathory. That ain't my Christian name mind you, gave that up a while back."

"Pleasure to meet you Mary."

"This here is Eli and Loretta", she gestured to the boy and girl in turn.

"Howdy" they drawled ironically, intimating Mary's own.

"A pleasure", and Tom doffed his hat slightly, a Boss of the Plains that was more a patchwork than original, the amount of times he had mended it.

"Where you headed", this time it was Loretta who asked. She was more plump, dressed for colder climes.

"Nowhere in particular, just east."

"Just east? What's east?"

"Same as what's back west. Nothing." Old Tom's reply put a pause in the conversation. The boy attempted to clear his throat, but it turned into one of those juvenile coughs; head angled up and the mouth wide open.

"Well Mr Frost, I will have to inform you kindly that you are crossing through the lands of the Sons and Daughters of the Chupa Cabra, Southern Mojave Eastern Chapter."
"There weren't no sign."

"Are you serious? I mean there must have been unless it got battered in one of them storms", Mary's affected confidence seemed to dim somewhat, her imperiousness when introducing her band seemed less haughty now.

"I'm just passing through honest, I didn't mean to intrude."

"Well, according to the treaty of the land that we got with the Wendigos of the West out near California's border any trespassers in the land are subject to a fine."
"A fine?"

"A fine yes."

"But I'm not with the Wendigos", Old Tom was quite confused by this point and more than a little peeved.

"I'm sure you're not but them's the rules you see." A silence draped in that desert air, drying out.

"There weren't no sign"

"I get that! But you're trespassing old man and if you keep saying stupid shit you're gonna be more than just fined" screamed Lorretta, pulling a Smith & Wesson revolver out of her dungarees, the boy followed suit with a bowie knife too big for his wrists.

"Woah there you two calm down! He's clearly not up to speed with the laws. Eli put that knife 'fore you hurt yourself." Loretta was advancing quickly with her pimpled mien set in a scowl when Mary stepped in her way.

"Back down kid." Tom watched this interchange, bemused rather than scared hoping he would not have to do anything untoward on pain of death. 

"Look, I'll just be on my way I'm sorry to have been a bother. Maybe I can give you a few dollars for it"

"What good is that gonna do" Mary said distracted, irritated that she had to stand down her inferior whose gun rested by her side, child wrists too tired to brandish it in her pantomime of intimidation.

"Oh, yeah." Money was only as good as the banks, whatever shape they were in Tom had no idea. He had some leafy notes tucked away in the threadbare corners of his wallet, not worth bartering for as toilet paper. His attention had turned to the boy, who was picking his nose whilst the cruel dagger hung limply by his side, the shade of a child and his teddy somewhere in there. The two girls' argument seemed to escalate all the while and he had noticed more movement in his periphery as more of the camp woke up. "Listen here Mary, the only reason you're the boss is because you're older but you're too much of a pussy to even carry a weapon. You let me handle this!"

"I'm in charge because I understand the rules Lorry, you can't be out here threatening folk! He clearly don't know the laws! He said there weren't no sign and he don't look to be lying", she smiled at him nervously over her shoulder.

"Well I'll teach him the laws", Lorretta cocked the revolver, shoving Mary and making to run towards old Tom. Mary kicked her legs out from under her clumsily. The shot rung out in the dawn air, smoke rising from the sand where Lorretta's gun lay buried. She lay there for several seconds and it was almost as if a mirage began to form around head, as she slowly turned around seething.

"You bitch! You could have fucking killed me. What, just for some foreign dumbass who couldn't read a fucking sign?"

"There weren't no sign."

"Shut your trap, you bastard geezer" the stout girl's anger lashed at him, and despite her inferior age there was a dangerous edge that crept into her voice. Her eyes had not left Mary, who was slowly backing away hands out in front in a warding gesture. 

"Now look here Lorretta, there's no need to be waving guns around especially at your own Blood Sister."

"Blood Sister my hairy ass, I have had enough of your pussyfooting. I'll be doing the Ram a favour getting rid of you. You ain't worthy of her blood"

"Hey now, look there's no need for this I'll come along! I don't have much on me but I'm sure we can trade for something"

"I said, shut the fuck up! You're next after I pop this twot", Loretta cocked back the hammer of her gun. The boy had moved unnoticed, his shadow lying across the seated girl when he swung the pommel of his Bowie knife into her temple. She noticed it too late, her body folding forward from the blow. Old Tom was not sure if he had heard a crack. 

"Cycle your way into camp now traveller before I gut ye", Eli ordered in a bored, congested tone as he gestured across his body with the knife pointing to the camp. A juvenile road marker. Frost decided to get of his bike and walk it towards the camp to build some trust. Mary lift-dragged the younger girl, the drag path disappearing that of the man and his bike. Eli bought up the rear. 

More of the camp's inhabitants had turned out to watch them enter, disgruntled. In addition to the camp dwellers' tents there were avenues formed by overhanging tarpaulins and canvas roofs in a warren around the central yurt. Atop this was the preternaturally large ram skull which on closer inspection looked pieced together by motely fragments of bone, both in size and colour. This township of rags had an odour about it. What remains after a hundred or so tan leather bodies have scrubbed themselves with sand. It was churned about by the desert breeze so Tom got it in waves. Looking around, saw one or two Children of the Chupa Cabra going about their morning toilet, or rather a simulacrum of it. Others appeared out of their tents into the morning air, lighting a cigarette or popping a bottle open the guzzle at the foamy brew therein. Everywhere he saw dull teeth sharpened to points. Half empty mouths of the stinking and wretched. He had slowed down in his observations as he entered the shadowed lanes of this strange bazaar, peering closer to see the fetishes adorned on the poles in front of tents. A plethora of bones, taws and shrunken body parts making of the camp's streets a macabre carnival.
