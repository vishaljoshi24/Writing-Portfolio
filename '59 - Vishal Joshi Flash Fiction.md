"1959, a great and terrible year for Jazz..." my old man used to say. Lady Day and Prez were dead - the brown and the drink the respective culprits. But so many classics that would define the Jazz to come had been birthed. He was swimming in a mythic zeitgeist. I can almost see him now, when I remember him reminiscing, there on the cusp of the '60s, viewed from a distance; a twilight scene of friends become strangers embracing in the neon lights of a bowling alley. Kindred romantics of a bygone era had their visions of Arcadia, well, that was it for me; halogens bathing a covenant in gloaming on the doorstep of the Purple Decades. 

I liked my father when he talked in this way, eyes all glazed over with nostalgia. I loved him always, but we were best of friends when he spoke to me of those sun-kissed years he had in his youth. And in such moments I would play the eager student, asking questions I myself thought to be too stupid to warrant an answer. But he would indulge me and go on as he did, working himself into an apotheosis of joy. 

Some cynical part of me wanted to speak out about how it can't have all been good with what the state of the world was in that penultimate year of the 50s. How the monstrous apathy of the nation meant my friends' predecessors existed as second-class citizens, a world still scarred by horrors for which the carpenter could not be a scape-goat, a world. . .whose future in war was a field of mushroom clouds growing into the cold interstellar void. I did not resent my father's joy, but the wide eyed ignorance of him and his that was strangling my future.
